# Minesweeper Game

This repository contains the minesweeper game implementation in C++ using the wxWidgets library to create a GUI.



## Game rules

1. The player must choose one of the grid fields to start the game.
2. The player must rely on the numbering on the field without mines to find out if there are mines on adjacent fields.

3. If the player selects a field with a mine, it's game over.
4. The player wins by going through the entire grid revealing all fields that do not have mines.



## Credits

This implementation of Minesweeper was instructed by the channel javidx9
